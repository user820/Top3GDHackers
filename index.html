        <p>I'm not making this for sympathy or pity or anything like that. I’m writing this because to clear everything up, apologize and put a conclusion to this. This will address how and why I hacked achievements, apologies to players that I’ve held back and what I’ll do moving forward. These will include only the truth, there’s no reason to lie anymore and the community deserves a response at the very least.

            I started playing Geometry Dash during late March early April and beat levels such as decode, windy landscape and leyak. During the period of beating these levels I’d also gotten 77% on cataclysm which I would drop. After this I decided on beating my first extreme which was Wasureta. My completion of Wasureta as a jump from leyak is legitimate. After this I’d set my eyes on my next extreme demon being The Golden. To this day I still have 96% on the level and haven’t finished it legitimately since. My completion of The Golden was accidentally noclipped and I hadn’t realized it was noclipped until around 20 minutes after I actually beat the level. I then decided to submit the record anyways with the mindset of “oh well if it gets caught whatever i'll just quit”. To my surprise the record was accepted and then I never looked back. My next extreme demon would end up being Kenos which is my hardest demon. I had originally gotten a 97% fail on the level with many more fails at the ending to then beat the level legitimately with an obs bug which made it so the screen was frozen. After trying to rebeat it afterwards I then hacked it for a record on the list as I already knew that it already had a good chance of passing through after a noclipped run of the golden was put on the list. How did I hack it? I bought zbot and recorded a macro and clicked over it. That's it, nothing complicated just a simple clicking over a macro. This method of hacking was used for about 90% of all my hacked completions. Everything that followed afterwards was mostly hacked with a few exceptions. Most top levels I was already good enough to play so whenever I got bored I would just pathetically hack them. I lied to all the friends I had made online and betrayed their trust. The more hacked levels the harder it was to say anything about it to the point where I just stopped caring. Just complete loser behavior. I’d then go on to hack slaughterhouse but instead of just clicking over I spent a short time terribly just aligning clicks which turned out to be terrible but uploaded it anyway. Fast forward to the recent records. They were just simply hacked by clicking over a macro but with a handcam.
            
            I'd like to formally apologize to:
            Crisis
            Wolvez
            -Doggie
            -Icedcave
            -RG
            -Spirtex
            -Snowballerr
            -Jeller
            -Bigthunder
            -Zoink
            -Trick
            -Skzyl
            -Cobrablitz
            -Cursed
            All the close friends I've made online
            The Geometry Dash community as a whole
            
            What does this mean for me? I want to try to still make things right even if it's only a little thing. For all the first victor titles I’ve robbed I’ll be giving the money made from the monetization from those videos back to players who actually deserve it. I know saying sorry or doing this isn't even close to making up for everything I’ve done but it's the least I can do. You can ask any questions you want on the quote tweet of this and I’ll reply to all the relevant questions for as long as I can.</p>
